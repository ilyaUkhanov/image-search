## Advanced search in images

### Synopsis

Google Drive and Apple Photos provides a way to search images using keywords, for instance search "dog" and find all your pictures of your dog.

In this technical test we will create a backend to upload images, generate keywords for them in a async queue, then expose a search endpoint.

### Subject

1. The development must be in **python** using **FastApi**.
2. You will provide a README.md containing description of how to run your project.
3. You will note the time used for this project but there is no strict time limit.
4. Finally the code will be accessible from your Github with the license you prefer (MIT, AGPL, etc). In this specific test you can have two folders `frontend/` and `backend/`

Your focus will be:
- Create a **FastApi** python server
- Use a small database (or directly store in JSON files, use what you prefer) to store the keywords of the files
- Implementing a MQ (message queue service) using **RabbitMQ** with docker `docker run -d -p 5672:5672 rabbitmq:3-management` and https://github.com/pika/pika (normalement le username/password sera guest:guest, un exemple de emiter/consumer de job est pr√©sent ici: https://github.com/pika/pika#example)
- Use the caption generator from https://hub.docker.com/r/codait/max-image-caption-generator (as described in #use-the-model you just have to call it as an external API on port 5000)
- Do some frontend from an existing code base

### Work to do (backend)

1. Install/run/test the libraries mentioned above
2. Create two endpoints: upload a file, and search file
3. The upload endpoint must: store the file, add it to the database, then create a rabbitmq job (the job will only contain the database id)
4. Create a rabbitmq job listener that will handle any incomming job, call the max-image-caption-generator, wait for reply and update the database object.
5. Create a search file endpoint. If no search term is provided, return everything the most recent first. Or use the search term to select corresponding images. Also includes pagination and limits.

### Work to do (frontend)

1. Download and open the attached ZIP (https://gist.github.com/RomaricMourgues/789394db37760a0e21bd36b1fa4fca89/raw/19fb1a98d33cdb72d7dcd0552083e35cd0217c34/frontend.zip) that contains an initial code base in React, note: this project uses **typescript**, **tailwind**, and React **hooks**.
2. Run a `yarn install` then `yarn start` you should see a basic search bar
3. Implement the two functions in `src/features/photo-library/api-client/api-client.ts`, the `search` function must retrieve from python server a `list of strings`. The upload function must just upload the file to the backend.
4. When uploading a file, you can edit the `src/views/index.tsx` to call `await search("")` just after `await upload(file)` to refresh the list of displayed items.

### What is expected

We want to test your ability to implement and learn new technologies together and create a clean application.
Here you will explore the message queues and see their advantage for async jobs, do not hesitate to read some documentation about MQ advantages and use cases.
Finaly the technical test is a fullstack test and we expect a fully working frontend and backend all together.

### To continue... (not included in the technical test)

- There is some little improvements to do, for instance, if we already started a search in the search bar, uploading a file should clear this search bar too if we refresh the list of files.
- There is no rules in backend or frontend to refuse non-image files, wich could lead to some bugs.
- The frontend could be improved to support drag and drop images, sho something when there is no photos etc
- We could also upload files to a S3 service like Minio
- I don't talk about creating a documentation of the REST endpoints, but of course in real life it should exists
- Adding some tests is always great, though it could be difficult as we must have a max-caption-generator running for the tests.
